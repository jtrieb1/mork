# Welcome to Mork
Mork is an incredibly dumb exercise in building a Zork-like in C.
I thought this would be fun to do, and I was right. It's been a blast.
I'm not sure how far I'll take this, but I'm having fun with it.
Currently using this as an exercise in writing lightweight databases.

## Building
Mork is pretty easy to build. Just run `make` in the root directory and you'll see mork appear in the `bin` directory.
There are also some unit tests that run during the build process. If you want to run them manually, just run `make test`.
If any of those tests fail, I'd love to hear about it. Please open an issue.

## Running
To run Mork, just run `./bin/mork`. You'll be dropped into the game, or as much of it as there is.
